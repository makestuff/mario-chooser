------------------------------ MARIOCART CHOOSER -------------------------------

A firmware for an AT90USB162 which drives a 20x4 LCD. It randomly assigns four
characters to each of the four players, and randomly chooses four of the 32
tracks in the game. Pointless, but fun.

The connections are described here:

Apart from the LCD, you just need a button attached between PD7 and GND, which
"spins" the randomiser.
